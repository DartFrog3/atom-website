        <h3>RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
      </div>
      <div id="reclist">
        <section>
          <h4>Recommendations:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Due to the COVID-19 regulations on social distancing, Urban Air Mobility research should be continued</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Small aircraft that seat 6 or less may appeal to people who are worried about their safety</li>
                <li>There has been extensive research done on electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (EVTOLS), and their presence in the airspace may come earlier than expected as COVID-19 has led to passengers being fearful of crowded commercial flights</li>
                <li>Research on how the public would respond to Urban Air Mobility may be helpful to see how it would be received</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Passengers may also start to pay for private chartered flights</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Because of this, air traffic controllers may have to be aware of an increase in air traffic. Smaller aircraft with less passengers may mean that more planes are flying in the sky</li>
                <li>Research that would support this development are projects such as NextGen, ATD-2, and testing done in the Air Traffic Control Simulator</li>
              </ul>
            <li>In addition, Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management may be useful during the pandemic</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Many people have been staying at home under a shelter in place or for fear of catching the virus. There have been a lot of deliveries, and UTM could help increase shipping efficiency. UTM would limit the contact between workers shipping goods and the customers which could put more people at ease.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
          <h4>Guidelines For The Future:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Safety</li>
              <ul>
                <li>In the case of a pandemic or health crisis, airlines should promote safety in airports and aircraft:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Information about where it has originated, how it is spread, and how to prevent the spread of the virus should be prominently displayed as soon as possible</li>
                    <li>Airlines should also require masks, social distancing, and sanitation once the virus is seen to be a threat</li>
                    <li>Flexible booking is also an important feature that allows someone who is sick to cancel their flight, and therefore protect others from exposure, without a penalty</li>
                    <li>Furthermore, because the aviation industry has experienced the effects of COVID-19, they should have protocols in place for biometric testing in the future</li>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
            <li>Recommendation to Protect Economic Interests:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Build Customer Confidence</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>While the safety guidelines above help protect passengers and airline workers, they also improve customer confidence. This is an important factor in the aviation industry recovering from COVID-19, and it will be a factor in future crises. The industry should take measures to protect everyone and show their customers that they are protecting. An increase in customer confidence can lead to an increase in bookings.</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Create flexibility for aircraft usage</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>One way for airlines in the future to protect their financial interests is to use more of their aircraft for cargo. Even though cargo shipping has gone down due to COVID-19, it has not been hit as hard as passenger air carriers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a couple passenger airlines, such as American Airlines, that have stripped the seats from a number of aircraft in order to ship cargo. This is a possible solution in the future as well. Even after COVID-19, airlines could integrate cargo shipping onto their passenger planes in order to establish flexibility in preparation for future events.</li>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
            <li>Humanitarian Interests:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>During COVID-19, many airlines have reached out and helped the community. They have donated food, transported medical equipment and flown medical professionals to places in need. This type of support has been important during the COVID-19 pandemic, and will likely be important in the future.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Airline food should be donated if there are no passengers because many people have struggled financially during the pandemic, and otherwise, it would go to waste</li>
                    <li>The help that airlines have given in making medical care more accessible is very important as well. Masks can slow the spread of a virus, and other supplies make it possible for hospitals to treat people with a virus. The supplies help “flatten the curve,” preventing hospitals from being overloaded.</li>
                  </ul>
