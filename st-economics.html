        <p>The aviation industry makes up a significant portion of the United States’s economy. Before COVID-19, it generated $1.6 trillion in annual economic 
          activity and supported 5% of the nation’s GDP. Like other industries, aviation has also been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The IATA has 
          estimated that airlines will lose $84.3 billion in 2020, making this year the worst year in the history of the air industry. In April, air traffic dropped 
          to having 5% of the number of passengers in 2019, and even in June, that percentage did not rise above 60%. In April through March, countries put up international travel bans, and many states in the U.S. implemented shelter in place orders. These restrictions and the fear of the virus led to air traffic decreasing drastically, and about half of all aircraft were grounded. Airlines lost millions of dollars a day. 	
          Most airlines need a load factor between 72% to 80% on each flight to generate profit. A load factor is a measure of capacity utilization. As the first 
          months of 2020 had depressed air traffic, airlines were losing money with every flight. At its worst, Delta airlines had a daily cashburn of $100 million, 
          and in June, Delta had a cashburn of about $50 million a day. Other U.S. mainline carriers had daily cashburns ranging from $1 million dollars to $40 
          million. The industry has lost hundreds of millions of dollars since January, when the first partial travel ban was put in place. The U.S. mainline 
          carriers have reported net losses in the first quarter of 2020. Combined, their losses add up to more than $5 billion. For Southwest Airlines and Delta 
          Airlines, it has been the first reported loss in more than 5 years. Moving forward, although air traffic is not expected to be as low as it was in April 
          2020, airlines predict a slow recovery.</p>
          
          <h5>THE CARES ACT</h5>
          
          <p>These losses have resulted in airline corporations dropping in value as investors are not receiving the returns they expected. Federal funding has played a 
            key role in preventing stock prices from crashing to $0. In order to protect American jobs and businesses, Congress passed the CARES Act on March 27, 2020. 
            The CARES Act designated billions of dollars for the industry with $50 billion for U.S. passenger air carriers alone. It provided loan funding: </p>
          
          <ul id="stlist">
            <li><p>$25 billion dollars for passenger air carriers, repair stations, and ticket agents</p></li>
            <li><p>$4 billion for cargo carriers, $17 billion for businesses critical to national security</p></li>
            <li><p>$454 billion for “distressed businesses” (other transportation businesses apply as well)</p></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>In addition to loans, the CARES Act has given grants to airlines in order to prevent furloughs and protect jobs. The grants are intended to cover salaries and compensate non-executive employees. The $32 billion for grants is divided up between the different sectors in the air industry:</p>
          
            <ul id="stlist">
              <li><p>$25 billion for passenger air carriers</p></li>
              <li><p>$4 billion for cargo air carriers</p></li>
              <li><p>$3 billion to airline contractors (including caterers, baggage handlers, and wheelchair pushers).</p></li>
            </ul>
          
          <p id="intextsource">(Source: Highlights of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act))</p>
          
          <h5>VOLUNTARY LEAVE</h5>
          
          <p>Airlines that accepted aid from the CARES Act were required to use the money to pay their non-executive employees salaries and to not furlough or cut 
            pay rates. These guidelines helped protect jobs, but many workers were still financially impacted. Working hours were reduced, and thousands of airline 
            employees have signed up for unpaid or partially paid leave at the encouragement of their employers. America, Delta, and United have more than 30%, or 
            120,000, of their workers on some type of voluntary leave. Delta alone has around 30,000 employees on voluntary unpaid leave.</p>
          
          <h5>MERGERS AND BANKRUPTCY </h5>
          
          <p>Despite federal aid, there were airlines that did not make it through the pandemic. Some companies were forced to merge or declare bankruptcy as a 
            result of the depressed demand for air travel. Miami Air suspended operations and filed for bankruptcy on March 24. The company was unable to raise 
            sufficient funds to get through the pandemic and struggled to find investors or parties interested in buying its assets. RavnAir, a regional airline 
            based in Alaska, filed for bankruptcy in April, and was forced to liquidate their assets when it was given a fraction of what it asked from the CARES 
            Act. Other airlines such as Trans States and Compass also filed for bankruptcy in April. Furthermore, there has already been a case of a merger between 
            two Hawaiian airlines. Makani Kai Air has merged with Mokulele Airlines to create more stability in the face of the pandemic. Although the demand for air 
            travel has begun to slowly rise, there is still a possibility of more bankruptcies and mergers as companies try to recover from debt.</p>
          
          <h5>FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS</h5>
          
          <p>As everyone learns to manage life with the threat of COVID-19, air travel will depend on passenger confidence. Airlines should be taking measures to ease 
            the minds of customers. Requiring masks is seen as a necessary guideline by many customers and would affect which airline people choose to fly on. 
            Airlines should be enforcing social distancing and showing that they keep their crafts cleaned and well maintained. 

          <p>Now that the worst of the virus is presumed to be over, IATA recommends alternatives to quarantine. To allow travel to continue in the presence of the 
            virus, airlines can allow their customers more flexibility when booking flights. People who are feeling unwell or are showing signs of the virus may 
            cancel their flight without extra fees. According to the IATA, travel documents should also transition to digital devices in order to minimize contact 
            between people, and biometric testing should be done when possible. This testing increases customer confidence as an IATA survey showed that 80% of 
            travelers felt safer when they learned passengers had their temperature taken before boarding. IATA also encourages COVID-19 testing for flyers who come 
            from high risk areas. In the cases where a passenger with COVID-19 is found to have flown, IATA recommends efficient contact tracing to alert other 
            passengers on the same flight that they were at risk for contracting COVID-19.</p>
